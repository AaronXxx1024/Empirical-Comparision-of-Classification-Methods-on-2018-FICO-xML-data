## About
A stable credit score can be a good starting point to mitigate risk in a risky economy for many people. On the other hand, it is also equally important for the banks to predict 
different potential “high-quality” borrowers to credit them accordingly. 
The leading company on this topic of credit scoring is FICO and our project was inspired by the paper “Machine Learning and FICO® Scores” written by them. 
The dataset was provided through a machine learning challenge hosted by FICO where the contestants tried their best to create a model that can predict an outcome of a client 
based on various variables about the client. This project follows a similar objective where I will predict the quality of an individual based on their personal data and try 
to provide an explainable model.
